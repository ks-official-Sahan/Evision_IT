Extended Research & Optimisation Plan for Evision IT (2026)
1 Research highlights
1.1 Advanced UI/UX & CX principles
•	Clarity, simplicity & reduced cognitive load – Keep UIs clear and simple. Users should never guess what to do next; limit choices (Hick’s law) and remove unnecessary elements to lower cognitive load[1].
•	Consistency – Reuse colours, components and terminology across the entire site. Internal consistency builds familiarity and trust, while external consistency aligns with expected patterns (e.g., standard navigation patterns)[2].
•	Visual hierarchy – Guide the user’s eye using size, colour contrast and placement; primary actions should be more prominent than secondary ones[3]. F‑ and Z‑reading patterns dictate where to position important information.
•	Accessibility as a non‑negotiable – Inclusive design broadens the audience and improves SEO. Strong colour contrast (checked against WCAG), readable fonts and keyboard navigation are essential[4].
•	Instant feedback & micro‑interactions – Interfaces must respond to user actions (hover states, success/failure messages, loading indicators) to build confidence[5]. Micro‑interactions should be purposeful and not distract from tasks.
•	Gestalt principles – Use proximity, similarity, closure, continuity and common region to group related elements and create intuitive layouts[6].
•	Human psychology & trust – Good UIs provide immediate answers to visitors’ problems and instil trust. People scan in predictable patterns, so top‑left and centre areas deserve attention. Trust signals (reviews, certifications, case studies) reinforce confidence.
1.2 Trends shaping UX/CX in 2026
•	Multimodal & sentient interfaces – UIs increasingly combine voice, text, images and gestures. Sentient interfaces adapt to the user’s mood or context (e.g., slower animations when stress is detected)[7].
•	AI co‑pilots & on‑device intelligence – AI assistants are becoming core features. On‑device processing delivers immediate responses and keeps data local; designers must provide clear boundaries and user control[8].
•	Hyper‑personalisation with ethics – Interfaces adjust in real time based on location, time, and behaviour. Around 80 % of consumers expect personalisation; however, users disengage if it feels intrusive[9]. Provide transparent controls and focus on helpfulness.
•	Compliance‑driven UX – New regulations raise the bar for accessibility, privacy and sustainability. Designers must audit contrast, focus indicators and motion sensitivity early in the process.
•	Functional minimalism & meaningful micro‑interactions – Minimalist layouts combined with subtle interactions improve focus and reduce cognitive load.
•	Sustainable & mindful design – Sustainability and digital wellbeing become part of UX practice, impacting colour choices, energy use and content consumption.
1.3 Dark & light theme best practices
•	User‑centric rationale – Dark mode isn’t just trendy; it reduces eye strain, saves battery on OLED screens and appeals to certain users[10]. Light mode remains better in bright environments.
•	Avoid pure black and pure white – Use dark greys (e.g., #121212) for backgrounds and off‑whites (e.g., #E0E0E0) for text to reduce glare[11]. Pure black and pure white produce harsh contrasts and eye fatigue.
•	Adjust accent colours – Desaturate vibrant hues (reduce saturation 20‑30 %) for dark mode and ensure primary colours still meet contrast ratios[11].
•	Provide manual toggles – Always offer a toggle to override system preferences[12]. Respect users’ environment (night vs. day) and autonomy.
•	Plan colour palettes – Build separate palettes for light and dark variants rather than inversion. Choose three to four brand colours and derive tints/shades for backgrounds, surfaces, text and interactive elements.
•	Energy efficiency – Dark mode extends battery life on OLED/AMOLED devices by up to 30 %[13].
1.4 Glassmorphism & visual style trends
•	Glassmorphism decline – Many designers report glassmorphism’s poor readability and performance. Accessibility considerations and user goals should trump decorative effects[14].
•	If used, control opacity & blur – Fine‑tune opacity and blur to balance depth and readability. Avoid overly transparent layers; provide crisp borders and soft shadows.
•	Adopt balanced aesthetics – A modern aesthetic combines minimalism, subtle gradients, soft shadows and occasional tactile textures (liquid glass) inspired by Apple iOS 18. Use sparingly to maintain focus.
1.5 Competitive landscape & pricing (Sri Lanka)
•	Web design & development pricing – Small‑business websites with up to seven pages, responsive design, basic SEO and contact forms start around LKR 30,000 (~USD 90) and scale with complexity[15].
•	Digital marketing packages – Monthly digital marketing retainers range from USD 500 to USD 17,500 depending on scope (SEO, PPC, social, content); hourly rates for digital marketing talent range $20–$50[16].
•	SEO services in Sri Lanka – Retainers for small websites start around LKR 50,000–100,000/month; medium websites LKR 100,000–200,000; large/e‑commerce sites LKR 200,000–400,000+[17]. Hourly rates for freelance SEO specialists range LKR 3,000–20,000[18].
•	Competitor agencies – Agencies such as Antyra Solutions (hospitality‑focused) offer web design, SEO and digital marketing with project costs USD 10,000–49,000 and emphasize measurable results (204 % organic traffic growth)[19]. Many agencies focus on hospitality and tourism, leaving room for Evision IT to differentiate through tech and SME solutions.
1.6 SEO & SERP optimisation
•	Core SEO fundamentals – Research user intent and keywords; craft clear titles, meta descriptions and headings; optimise images, internal links and sitemaps; ensure responsive design and fast page speed[20]. These fundamentals remain essential even with AI search.
•	Generative search & AI Overviews – Zero‑click searches continue to rise; AI overviews appear for over 50 % of queries. Generative Engine Optimisation (GEO) emphasises providing authoritative, structured, up‑to‑date information so that AI assistants cite your content[21].
•	Local & global SEO – For Sri Lanka, focus on local search (Google Business Profile, local keywords) and languages (Sinhala, Tamil, English). For international markets, use domain or sub‑folder targeting with hreflang tags and localised content.
•	Technical SEO – Maintain fast page speed (LCP < 2.5 s, FID < 100 ms, CLS < 0.1) and structured data (FAQ, Service, LocalBusiness). Optimise indexing by using robots.txt, sitemaps and canonical tags.
1.7 Traffic & lead‑generation strategies
•	Paid advertising – Google Local Services Ads and geo‑targeted social ads remain the fastest ways to capture in‑market leads[22]. Ensure landing pages are high quality and trust signals are visible.
•	SEO & content marketing – Organic search still matters despite AI; build content that answers “people also ask” queries, appear in video carousels and map packs, and earn branded searches[23].
•	Social demand creation – Use short videos, creator collaborations and helpful community posts to warm audiences and retarget them later[24].
•	Outbound & CRM – Use firmographic and intent data to target accounts; automate personalised emails and calls[25].
•	Partnerships & referrals – Co‑branding and referrals convert at higher rates[26].
•	Events & webinars – Teaching sessions and recordings generate mid‑funnel interest and can be repurposed for content[27].
•	Conversational marketing – AI chatbots and voice assistants provide immediate answers on high‑intent pages, qualify leads and book meetings, reducing friction[28].
•	Values‑based branding – Define a one‑sentence promise tied to outcomes (e.g., reliability, security), and show proof (certifications, reviews) across ads and landing pages[29].
•	Video & interactive content – Short explainer videos and interactive calculators lift conversion rates[30].
1.8 Animation & performance optimisation
•	GSAP (GreenSock) – Optimise by using will-change sparingly for complex transformations, staggering animations to avoid simultaneous triggers, animating via transform/opacity instead of left/top or width/height, and killing unused animations[31][32]. Avoid heavy blending filters and large numbers of SVG animations[33].
•	Framer & other libraries – Optimise images (WebP, auto sizing) and fonts (WOFF2, font-display: swap). Use deferred or async script loading and place scripts at the end of body[34].
•	Scroll‑based & 3D – Use GPU‑accelerated transforms, batch operations and matchMedia to tailor animations to device capabilities. Test on low‑end devices.
1.9 Frameworks and tooling
•	Next.js 16 – Introduces Cache Components for partial pre‑rendering, Turbopack bundler (10× faster refresh), React 18 & compiler integration, improved caching APIs, proxy.ts for network boundaries and improved logging[35][36]. These features reduce build time and enable incremental adoption of server components. Use stable Next.js 16 for SSR/SSG with SEO benefits and server actions for secure data access.
•	Vite – Provides faster HMR and flexible configuration but lacks built‑in SEO support; better for prototypes or small projects[37].
•	Tailwind CSS – Utility‑first framework that improves consistency and performance; version 4 brings 40–60 % faster builds due to a new engine[38].
•	GSAP, Framer Motion, Three.js, WebGL – Use for interactive, high‑performance animations and 3D. Combine with ScrollTrigger for narrative scrolling experiences, but follow performance tips above.
•	MongoDB & Next.js – When using MongoDB with Next.js, use server components or API routes to query data; ensure indexes, caching and connection pooling for performance[39].
1.10 Content strategy & blogs
•	E‑E‑A‑T & trust – Content should demonstrate experience, expertise, authority and trust. Use clear headings, structured answers, internal links and citations. Answer queries comprehensively and ethically.
•	Dynamic content & automation – Use CMS (MongoDB + Next.js) to manage blog posts, with fields for meta titles, descriptions, keywords and structured data. Provide manual overrides but automate suggestions based on content.
•	Blog performance – Optimise images, implement lazy loading, prefetch next pages, and use static generation for posts. Provide reading time and table of contents to improve engagement.
1.11 Branding & visual identity
•	Brand promise – Evision IT should position itself as a trusted digital transformation partner combining robust IT infrastructure, software engineering and growth marketing. Communicate reliability, security and measurable outcomes.
•	Colour palette – Use the previously selected palette (Raisin Black #212121, Soft Neutral White #F5F5F5, Evision Blue #0A2A66, Evision Teal #005A5A) with tints and shades. Ensure AAA contrast for core text and CTAs.
•	Typography – Use a modern variable sans‑serif like Inter or Manrope; base size 16 px; maintain hierarchy and comfortable line‑height.
•	Tone & personality – Friendly and professional; avoid jargon; emphasise empowerment and partnership.
2 Comparison & analysis of current plan vs research
Area	Current plan summary	Research insights & gaps	Improvement recommendations
Design foundations	Minimalist, premium, techie aesthetic; focus on white/black neutrals; emphasised consistency and readability.	Research supports minimalism and high contrast, but emphasises clarity, consistency, visual hierarchy and Gestalt principles[40][3].
Maintain minimalism; refine using Gestalt principles; ensure each page has a clear focal point; reduce choices; reuse UI patterns; add micro‑interactions for feedback.
Dark vs light themes	Use Raisin Black, Soft Neutral White, Evision Blue, Evision Teal; maintain AAA contrast; provide dark/light compatibility.	Dark mode benefits include reduced eye strain and energy savings; avoid pure black/white; desaturate accents; provide a manual toggle[10][11].
Adjust dark palette: use #121212 as dark background; off‑white text; tone down blues/teals in dark theme. Provide theme toggle and prefers-color-scheme detection.
Visual trends & style	Intends to include glassmorphism and modern effects.	Research warns that glassmorphism reduces readability and may hinder accessibility[14]. If used, opacity/blur must be controlled.	Keep glass effects very subtle or avoid entirely. Use soft shadows, gradients and cards instead. Focus on clarity and performance rather than trendiness.
Animations	Plan to use GSAP/Framer Motion and possibly 3D.	Performance tips: animate with transforms and opacity, avoid layout properties, use staggering, and remove unused animations[31][32]. Use matchMedia for responsive animation.	Implement animations to enhance storytelling (e.g., solution finder, section reveals) but keep them lightweight and respect prefers-reduced-motion. Optimise with GPU transforms and kill off-screen animations.
Customer experience (CX)	Provide solution‑selector funnel, friendly professional tone, strong CTAs and trust signals.	Lead generation research emphasises conversational marketing (AI chatbots), personalisation, values-based branding, video & interactive tools[28][29].
Add AI chatbots or live chat to qualify leads; implement interactive calculators (project estimator) and short explainer videos; highlight Evision IT’s brand promise (reliability, security, growth). Offer webinars and case study downloads.
SEO & content	SEO friendly content and dynamic blog; plan manual SEO configuration.	SEO fundamentals remain crucial; generative search emphasises authority, recency and structured data[20][21]. Use local SEO for Sri Lanka and global SEO for target markets; dynamic metadata; structured data.	Build content clusters around service categories; implement Answer Engine Optimisation (AEO); include FAQ and how‑to sections; integrate schema (FAQ, Service, LocalBusiness, Breadcrumb). Provide localised versions of pages and metadata.
Performance & optimisation	Use Next.js 16; emphasised mobile-first responsiveness.	Research emphasises Core Web Vitals, image optimisation (WebP/AVIF), code splitting, caching, CDNs and third‑party script management[41]. Tailwind CSS v4 improves build times[38]; Next.js 16 features reduce build time.	Implement global performance strategy: Next.js 16 with Cache Components; compress images to WebP/AVIF and lazy load; use HTTP/3 and CDN; minimise third‑party scripts; apply caching (ISR/SSR). Use Tailwind for consistent styling and performance.
Internationalisation (i18n)	Target Sri Lanka and international markets; plan to support multiple languages.	Local and global SEO require hreflang tags, domain or subpath for each locale; metadata should be localised; i18n improves discoverability and accessibility.	Use Next.js i18n routing to manage Sinhala, Tamil and English content; create locale-specific metadata and structured data; ensure translation quality; adopt localised keywords.
Blog & content marketing	Plans for dynamic blog with manual SEO fields; emphasised future phase.	E‑E‑A‑T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust) and dynamic content matter; blog posts should answer user questions comprehensively and link to service pages.	Build an editorial calendar; publish case studies, how‑to guides, and industry insights; embed interactive tools (ROI calculators); implement multi-language blog; optimise for AEO.
Branding	Use friendly professional tone; emphasise premium tech feel.	Branding research suggests values-based promises and consistent proof to build trust[29].
Develop a brand manifesto: “Empowering businesses through secure and high‑performance digital experiences.” Show certifications, testimonials, and measured outcomes on key pages.
3 Optimised UI/UX & CX plan for Evision IT
3.1 Site structure & navigation
1.	Home / Landing page – The most critical page; structure as follows:
2.	Hero section: Clear headline (e.g., “Empowering Businesses Through Digital Transformation”) with sub‑copy addressing pain points (manual processes, outdated systems). Provide primary CTA (“Get a Quote”) and secondary CTA (“Explore Solutions”). Use a background graphic or subtle animation representing transformation. Support dark & light themes.
3.	Solution finder: Add a three‑step interactive funnel (What do you need? – urgency – desired outcome) and summarise recommended services; auto‑populate the contact form.
4.	Trust bar: Show client logos, certifications and statistics (e.g., uptime, response time, project success) to build credibility.
5.	Solutions overview: Present three pillars (Digital Products & Growth; IT Infrastructure & Security; Managed Support) with cards linking to service pages.
6.	Outcomes & metrics: Use before/after metrics (load times, conversion improvements, security posture) to show ROI.
7.	Featured case studies: Highlight 2–3 projects with pictures, key results and links to full case studies.
8.	Process summary: Outline the 4‑step process (Discover → Design → Build → Optimize/Support) with icons.
9.	Testimonials: Carousel of client quotes; ensure high contrast and accessible navigation.
10.	Blog preview: Show recent articles or resources with images, titles and categories.
11.	Final CTA: Reiterate quote request and contact information; optionally include a chatbot prompt.
12.	Solutions category pages – Provide an overview of each pillar with sections for problems solved, deliverables, pricing ranges, and trust signals.
13.	Service detail pages – Template with hero + CTA, problems solved, deliverables list, process, proof (case studies/testimonials), FAQ, and CTA. Use on‑page SEO with structured headings and metadata.
14.	Portfolio/case studies – Filterable index with categories and tags; dynamic case study pages featuring problem, approach, solution, results (numbers), tech stack and client quote; include contact CTA.
15.	About – Vision, mission, story timeline, values, team photos, certifications, awards and process methodology.
16.	Blog – SEO‑optimised blog with categories (Technology, Digital Marketing, IT Support, Industry Trends), search, tags, reading time and translation toggles. Provide author bios and structured metadata.
17.	Quote/Contact – Multi‑step form or conversational interface; fields adapt based on solution finder; show contact details, map, company registration number and privacy notice.
18.	Legal – Privacy policy, terms of service and cookie preferences; accessible and translated.
19.	Localised pages – For each target region (Sri Lanka provinces and international markets), create landing pages with localised content, language, testimonials and keywords.
3.2 Components & design system
•	Design tokens – Use the defined colour palette (light and dark variants) with tokens for surfaces, text, borders and brand accents. Use CSS custom properties or Tailwind’s configuration. Ensure that all interactive elements meet at least AA contrast; core actions and content should aim for AAA.
•	Typography – Adopt Inter/Manrope variable fonts; base size 16 px; type scale for headings (H1 36–40 px; H2 28–32 px; H3 22–24 px); maintain 1.5–1.6 line‑height; include accessible letter spacing. Use two font families maximum (primary sans‑serif and optional monospace for code snippets).
•	Components – Buttons (primary, secondary, outline, ghost), cards, accordions, tabs, breadcrumbs, pagination, forms, toasts and modals. Document each component’s states (default, hover, active, focus, disabled) in both themes.
•	Animations – Use micro‑interactions: button hover (scale up 1–2 %), section reveal (fade + translate y), card hover (light lift), loader spinners. Use GSAP with GPU transforms and ScrollTrigger for narrative sections. Provide prefers-reduced-motion alternative.
•	Forms – Use persistent labels outside fields; provide inline validation and accessible error messages; group related fields (proximity principle); ensure 44×44 px touch targets.
•	Navigation – Fixed header with logo left, navigation links, dark/light toggle, language selector and CTAs. Mobile: hamburger menu with slide‑in drawer; bottom sticky CTA bar for quote/contact.
•	Accessibility features – Visible focus rings (≥ 3:1 contrast), skip links, ARIA labels, alt text for images, accessible colour palettes. Provide keyboard navigation for menus and forms.
3.3 Technical implementation & performance
•	Framework – Use Next.js 16 for SSR/SSG (for SEO), server components, and API routes. Enable Cache Components and Turbopack for faster builds and partial rerendering[35]. Use proxy.ts for API routing and caching.
•	Styling – Use Tailwind CSS (v4). Configure a dark/light theme with CSS variables; integrate with PostCSS and JIT. Leverage Tailwind’s performance improvements[38].
•	Animations – Use GSAP for scroll‑triggered animations; apply performance tips (transform/opacity, staggering, kill off-screen animations)[31]. For small UI transitions, use Framer Motion or native CSS transitions. Use Three.js only for a small 3D interactive element (e.g., interactive globe or network diagram) with caution about performance.
•	Image & asset optimisation – Convert images to WebP/AVIF, serve appropriate sizes via next/image, and lazy‑load below the fold. Use SVG for icons but avoid animating many heavy SVGs[33]. Optimise fonts to WOFF2 and use font-display: swap[42]. Defer non‑critical scripts and third‑party widgets.
•	SEO & structured data – Implement dynamic metadata per page (title, description, canonical), robots.txt, sitemap.xml and schema markup (BreadcrumbList, FAQ, Product/Service, LocalBusiness). Use next/head or the new metadata API in Next.js.
•	i18n & localisation – Use Next.js i18n routing; define locales (e.g., en, si, ta). Provide language toggles and store user preference. Translate text and meta tags; create locale‑specific slugs; use hreflang attributes.
•	Analytics & tracking – Implement privacy‑focused analytics (e.g., Plausible, Google Analytics 4) with consent management. Monitor Core Web Vitals using tools like Lighthouse and Web Vitals library.
•	Security & compliance – Enforce HTTPS, Content Security Policy, and secure headers. Implement rate limiting and input sanitisation. Provide accessible cookie consent controls.
•	CI/CD – Use GitHub Actions and Vercel (or similar) for automated builds, preview deployments, and integration tests. Monitor performance metrics post‑deployment.
3.4 Content & marketing strategy
•	Content pillars – Define content clusters around (1) Digital Product Development, (2) IT Infrastructure & Security, (3) Growth & Digital Marketing, and (4) Case Studies & Thought Leadership. Each cluster should include service pages, blogs, guides and resources.
•	Editorial calendar – Publish at least two long‑form posts per month. Prioritise topics addressing common questions (e.g., “How to choose an ERP system,” “Benefits of digital transformation for SMEs,” “IT security best practices in Sri Lanka”), trending technologies (AI, AR/VR) and localised content.
•	Lead magnets – Offer downloadable guides, ROI calculators, or checklists in exchange for contact details. Use interactive calculators to estimate project costs or returns.
•	Conversational marketing – Integrate chatbots (e.g., Crisp, Intercom) or AI assistants to answer questions, qualify leads and book consultations. Provide voice search compatibility for high‑intent queries (via structured Q&A content and transcripts).
•	Video & webinars – Produce short explainer videos for each service page and host periodic webinars or workshops (e.g., digital marketing for SMEs, IT infrastructure best practices). Repurpose recordings into blog posts and social clips.
•	Partnerships & referrals – Collaborate with complementary businesses (e.g., tourism operators, SME associations) for co‑branded resources and referral programmes.
3.5 Customer experience & support
•	Personalisation & hyper‑personalisation – Use analytics and cookies to tailor content and CTAs (e.g., show “IT Support” solutions to returning visitors reading technical blogs). Provide an account area for clients to access project dashboards and tickets.
•	Onboarding & support – After a quote request, provide a clear next step: send a project brief template, schedule a discovery call, or share a case study relevant to their industry. Offer remote and on‑site support packages with clear SLAs.
•	Feedback loops – Gather feedback post‑project via surveys; display aggregated satisfaction metrics; iterate on services.
•	Privacy & ethical data use – Clearly state how data is collected and used; allow users to manage preferences; limit personalisation to helpful features and provide opt‑out.
4 Conclusion
The extended research confirms that the initial UI/UX and CX strategy for Evision IT was directionally strong, focusing on a premium, minimalist and accessible design. However, 2026 trends and best practices emphasise clarity, simplicity, functional minimalism, AI‑enhanced experiences, lead generation through conversational and interactive tools, and strict performance & accessibility standards. The site must deliver lightning‑fast load times, adapt to dark/light preferences, provide multi‑language support, and feature micro‑interactions that reinforce trust without distracting.
